# Tailkit - Starter Kit - HTML

This is an HTML Starter Kit for using Tailkit - https://tailkit.com UI components out of the box in your project.

It is mostly for testing out the UI components and as a playground to experiment. It uses [Tailwind Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) under the hood.

If you would like to serve the index.html file and have it auto refresh on changes, then you could just install and use **live-server** npm package:

```
Requirements: node.js

Installation: npm install -g live-server

Development: live-server --watch=index.html
```
